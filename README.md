Uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset

## Features:

Image Augmentation to account for 'small' size of dataset.
Sequential Model with 2 CNNs and Batch descent
Classfication accuracy is stable >80% for current version.


## To Do:

1.Address Loss function creep up

2.Data Viz

3.Compare to basic scikit method

4.try deeper model with fewer params (Large Dense layer?)

5.Find other Xray sets to compare performace

6.EXTRACT FEATURES-->Heatmap? Filters?
